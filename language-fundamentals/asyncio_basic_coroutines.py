"""Asyncio requires the application code to handle context changes based on the idea of an
event loop.

The asyncio module provides tools for building concurrent applications using coroutines. While the
threading module implements concurrency through application threads and multiprocessing implements
concurrency using system processes, asyncio uses a single-threaded, single-process approach in
which parts of an application cooperate to switch tasks explicitly at optimal times.

Applications interact with the event loop to register code to run and let the loop call the code
when resources become available. e.g. registration of a network socket then awaits inbound
connections and calls back to application code when the event is fired.

Application code then yields control when no more work is to be done, in the example it could be
after an ack is sent.
