# Learning-python-3

## Jupyter-notebook-exercises
Using Jupyter Notebooks, these are are follow along exercises completed as part of the Udemy Python 3 Bootcamp completed. It's a good example of what you can do with Jupyter Notebooks too - which I think are great!

I'll use these more for any data science work in future.

## Language-Fundamentals
In here you can explore lots of different constructs that can be applied to Python 3.7+ to get a better idea of the language and how it fits together - take these concepts and apply them to projects.

## Projects

### Black-jack
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/chidgey/learning-python-3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chidgey/learning-python-3) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Learning-Python&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=Learning-Python)

Part of a series in simple game projects used to play around with control flow logic and data structures in Python 3.7+

Exploring the use of build pipe lines with Travis-CI - as the badges above illustrate.

### Tic tac toe
A classic and my first simple game to explore Python.

### Graphical work catalogue
My first attempt at creating a simple utility that can be used to construct a directory structure on disk for working with graphical assets used in client projects using the Affinity Designer, Photo and Publisher.

Hopefully this will make it easier to manage such projects in a consistent way.
