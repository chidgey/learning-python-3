# Learning-python-3

## Jupyter-notebook-exercises
Using Jupyter Notebooks, these are are follow along exercises completed as part of the Udemy Python 3 Bootcamp completed. It's a good example of what you can do with Jupyter Notebooks too - which I think are great!

I'll use these more for any data science work in future.

## Language-Fundamentals
In here you can explore lots of different constructs that can be applied to Python 3.7+ to get a better idea of the language and how it fits together - take these concepts and apply them to projects.

## Projects

### Black-jack and tic tac toe
These projects are part of a very basic games collection to explore how we can use control flow logic and data structures to represent some simple games.

I wrote these myself, instead of following along the Python 3 bootcamp as this proved to be a better learning experience - albiet slower.

### Graphical work catalogue
My first attempt at creating a simple utility that can be used to construct a directory structure on disk for working with graphical assets used in client projects using the Affinity Designer, Photo and Publisher.

Hopefully this will make it easier to manage such projects in a consistent way.

## DevOps - Travis CI
I'm exploring the use of Travis CI to build and test python projects, review .travis.yaml for more info.
